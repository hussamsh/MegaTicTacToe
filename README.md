## Motivation

This is a small project I did in my free time to experince basic gaming programming on android.

## Was any engines used in the creation of this game ?

None , this is pure android code, see for yourself !

## About the AI 

The AI was implemented using a minimax with alpha beta pruning algorithim , even though there are still alot to be done on it and it's still not that natrual to play with but it's suffient for a first release 

  Material that I used and inspired me:
- ["Tic Tac Toe java cas study : "](http://jfhbrook.github.io/2011/11/09/readmes.html) - *The AI is heavily based on the code found here*
- ["Understanding the minimax algorthim : "](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax) - *Awesome explanation to the minimax algorithim*
- ["MIT Lecture on Gaming AI programming : "](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik) - *Another awesome explanation to minimax and gaming AIs in general*
